### Objective
The GPA Calculator project is a command-line application developed in Python that computes the Grade Point Average (GPA) based on user-provided grades for multiple subjects or assignments. The application also assigns a corresponding letter grade based on the average score, using a standard GPA scale.

### Key Activities:

**Develop GPA Calculation Logic**:Implement the calculate_gpa function to convert an
average grade into GPA and letter grades based on predefined thresholds.
**User Input Collection**:Prompt the user to input the number of subjects and their respective grades.
Use a loop to gather and accumulate grades.
**Compute and Display Results**:Calculate the average grade from the total grades entered.
Display the average grade, letter grade, and GPA in a user-friendly format.

### Technologies Used
**Programming Language**: Python
Chosen for its readability and ease of use, making it ideal for quick development and educational purposes.

### Key Insights
**Input Validation**: Ensuring that grades are correctly input as floating-point numbers is essential for accurate calculations.
Modularity: Separating the GPA calculation logic into its own function improves code organization and maintainability.
**User Interaction**: Designing the user input flow enhances the overall user experience and makes the application intuitive.
Potential Improvements
**Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage non-numeric inputs or invalid grade entries, ensuring robust performance.
**Extended Functionality**: Allow users to specify different grading scales or weight grades based on assignment importance.
**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Create a GUI to enhance user engagement and usability, making the tool more accessible.

### Conclusion
The GPA Calculator project effectively demonstrates fundamental programming skills in Python, including user input handling, arithmetic operations, and function implementation. This project not only serves as a practical exercise for learning but also highlights the importance of modular design and user-friendly interfaces in software development. Future enhancements can expand its capabilities, making it a more versatile tool for students and educators alike.
